Plex Library Sync Utility

## Overview

The **Plexrr** Plex Library Sync Utility is a Node.js tool designed to help multiple Plex users browse each other's libraries and selectively sync individual movies or TV shows to a remote library. This allows seamless sharing without completely merging libraries or affecting metadata.

## Features

- üìÇ **Browse Plex Libraries** ‚Äì Query available libraries on your Plex server.
- üîç **Search & Select Media** ‚Äì Choose specific movies or TV shows to sync.
- üîÑ **File Transfer** ‚Äì Uses SFTP (via SSH) to copy selected media files to a remote server.
- üîê **Secure Authentication** ‚Äì Uses Plex API for library access and SSH for file transfers.
- üéÆ **Transfer Speed Control** ‚Äì Built-in throttling mechanism to limit bandwidth usage during transfers.

## How It Works

1. Connects to a Plex server using your **Plex token**.
2. Lists available **libraries** (Movies, TV Shows, etc.).
3. Allows the user to **select a movie/TV sho/musicw** to sync.
4. Extracts the **file path** of the selected media.
5. Transfers the file from a **remote server** via **SFTP**.
6. Optionally throttles transfer speed to maintain network stability.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following settings:

```env
PLEX_SERVER=http://your-plex-server:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your-plex-token
REMOTE_HOST=remote-server-hostname
REMOTE_USER=remote-username
REMOTE_PATH=/path/to/remote/media
LOCAL_PATH=/path/to/local/media
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/ssh/key
TRANSFER_SPEED_LIMIT=1  # Optional: Limit transfer speed in MB/s, leave blank for unthrottled
```

## Transfer Speed Control

The TRANSFER_SPEED_LIMIT setting allows you to cap the bandwidth used during file transfers:

- Set in megabytes per second (MB/s)
- Leave empty or remove for unlimited transfer speed
- Helps prevent network saturation during large transfers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js (16+)**
- **Plex Server** with API access
- **SSH access** to a remote server (for file transfers)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/plexrr.git
   cd plexrr
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Update the script with your **Plex Server URL** and **Plex Token**.
   - Provide **SSH credentials** for the remote server.

## Usage

Run the script using:

```sh
npm run start
```

Follow the prompts to select a library and media file for syncing.

## Next Steps

üöÄ **Enhancements in Progress:**

- **Batch Sync** ‚Äì Select multiple files for transfer at once.
- **Use Plex Download Feature** ‚Äì Should have started with this, but I had something in mind...
- **Multi-Plex Support** ‚Äì Allow syncing between different Plex servers.
- **Web UI** ‚Äì Build a web-based interface for easier use.
